Destroy Everything You Can Cities: Skylines Mod
===============================================

A W.I.P. Mod which will allow you to destroy all your buildings at once.

Done
----

- Added a button to destroy all the buildings.

Known issues
------------

- After using the `destroy everything!` button you cannot load a game from the
  same game. You'll need to go to the main menu to load it or Cities will crash
  —I think I've seen other mods doing this before.. if so, maybe it's a game bug.
- After destroying everything it takes a long after far scenes are rendered again.

TODO
----
- Destroy roads, tubes and other connection paths.
- Display a list of building types to destroy just one building type at once.
- Burn buildings (just for fun)
- Try to destroy buildings that require to be voided first (like dumps or the
  cementery).
