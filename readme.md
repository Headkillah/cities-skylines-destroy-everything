Destroy Everything You Can Cities: Skylines Mod
===============================================

A W.I.P. Mod which will allow you to destroy all your buildings at once.

Done
----

- Added a button to destroy all the buildings (just those that grew automatically).

Known issues
------------

- For huge cities (more than 10K citizens) it takes so long to destroy all the
  buildings. I recommend you to pause the game before destroying everything in
  those cases.

TODO
----
- Display a list of building types to destroy just one building type at once.
- Destroy roads, tubes and other connection paths.
- Burn buildings (just for fun)
- Try to destroy buildings that require to be voided first (like dumps or the
  cementery).
